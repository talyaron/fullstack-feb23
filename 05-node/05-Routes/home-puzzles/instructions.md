**Scenario: Task Manager**

You are building a basic task manager application. Each task has a unique ID, a title, a description, and a status (either "To-Do,"  "Done"). Your task is to implement the CRUD operations for managing tasks.

**Exercise Tasks:**

1. **Create:**
   Implement a function/method that allows the user to create a new task. The function should take input for the task's title, description, and status. It should assign a unique ID to the task and add it to the list of tasks.

2. **Read:**
   Implement a function/method that allows the user to view tasks. The function should provide options to view all tasks, tasks by status, or a specific task by its ID.

3. **Update:**
   Implement a function/method that allows the user to update a task. The function should take the task's ID as input and provide options to update the title, description, or status of the task.

4. **Delete:**
   Implement a function/method that allows the user to delete a task. The function should take the task's ID as input and remove the task from the list of tasks.

** Levels **

1) Do the above, only for entitiy Task. (Entities are just Taks, no Users)
2) Each user will have, her own list of tasks. (use Users and Tasks).The user can be chosen from a list of users in the main screen
3) The same as level 2, only that the user can create a new user, and choose it from the list of users in the main screen (use register and login screens)
