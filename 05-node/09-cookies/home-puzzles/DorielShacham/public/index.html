                        Selenium is a powerful and flexible automation tool primarily used for automating web
                        applications for testing purposes. It allows testers and developers to write scripts in various
                        programming languages like Java, Python, and more, to simulate user interactions with web
                        applications.

                    <p>
                        Selenium provides a suite of tools to automate web browsers, each with a specific role. Selenium
                        WebDriver is the most popular component, offering a programming interface to create and run test
                        cases. It interacts with a browser as a real user would, making it a crucial tool for functional
                        testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With Selenium WebDriver, you can perform actions such as clicking buttons, filling forms,
                        navigating through pages, and more. Its versatility and compatibility with various browsers make
                        it an essential tool for automated testing of web applications across different platforms.
