## easy
1. followup the params task:
    - create a users page and a link to 5 users.
    - install react-router-dom and use your prefered method to create routes.
    - prepare a route for /user/:id anr present UserPage element
    -using the params, get the user information by the user Id. use: 
    https://dummyjson.com/docs/users

## Advanced (requiers research)

1. after creating a new project, install react-router-dom and create base routes. 
-- they should include home page (that contained a homepage header and links to other routes)
-- a route that is called "settings"
in the setting route show a button that navigates back home, and a foum with two fields: name and last name.

**task:**
if the user did not write anything in the feilds, what they navigate bck home they will be allowed to do so.

if they did write anything in the fields and they try to navigate back, they will be showen a message that stops them and inform them that the navigation will resolt in loss of information. Clicking "I understand" on the prompt will navigate them home, and clicking "No, go back" will prevent them from navigating.

--tips:
1. you should create a component for the prompt, DO NOT use the premade prompt function, as it is not fit for this task/
2. try first to think about what the button that is presented on the page to navigate should do on click, and when.
