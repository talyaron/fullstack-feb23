1. create a basic to do list app. make sure you use components and props.

   - users see the list on the main page.
   - users can press a + button to add new to do item.
   - a prompt will open to add a new todo to the list.
   - users can than - cross a todo
     (text-decoration: line-through;)
   - users can delete a to so by pressing X button next to it.
   - users can edit a to do by pressing edit button (or pen icon). a prompt will open and allow user to edit the todo.
     \*\* assume users will not add the same to do twice.
