create a context for a user. after creating the context, add a button to your App 
//(use react router dom to create your routes).
the button should onclick, add a user to your context.
create 3 components and nest them in each other. (create card, mini card and container components, and have them render each other, on the app add card, inside card render mini card, etc)
in the lowest component, use the context to render somthing from the user information.
